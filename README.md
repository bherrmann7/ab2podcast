to listen to audiobooks

## Getting Started

1. rip some Audio Books using a ripping program (say itunes)
2. Start the application: `lein run`
3. Go to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) to see the podcasts

## configuration

On linux the ~/Music directory is expected to have the audio books in Author/Title/*.mp3 format

On OSX the default itunes home directory is used.
